/* EXERCISE 2
 Try to describe what an object is, in your own words.

/* EXERCISE 3
 Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

/* EXERCISE 4
 Create a variable named x and assign to it the number 12.
*/

/* EXERCISE 5
 Create a variable called name and assign to it your name as a string.
*/

/* EXERCISE 6
 Execute a subtraction between the number 4 and the variable x you declared before (which is storing the value 12).
*/

/* EXERCISE 7
Create two variables: name1 and name2. Assign to name1 the string "john", and to name2 the string "John" (this one has a capital J!)
 Verify that name1 is different from name2 (HINT: check their equality to be false).
 Finally, verify that the equality between name1 and name2 becomes true if both are lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
 YOU DON'T NEED AN IF/ELSE BLOCK. It is enough to use console.log()

/* WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED
 Upload the .js file on Eduflow before 5PM CET. In the next days we'll also learn how to use GIT!
